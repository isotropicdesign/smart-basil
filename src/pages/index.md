    content: We had [Isotropic] address some opportunities from our PageSpeed report,
      like incoroating WebP images on our Wordpress website. Because our site is an
      image based portfolio, it loaded MUCH quicker than before.

      the Isotropic Team. Within one day, our PageSpeed score increased by 13 points,
