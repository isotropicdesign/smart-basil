    content: We had [Isotropic] address some opportunities from our PageSpeed report,
      like incoroating WebP images on our Wordpress website. Because our site is an
      image based portfolio, it loaded MUCH quicker than before.

    content: Was able to schedule and get on an info call the same day that I contacted
      the Isotropic Team. Within one day, our PageSpeed score increased by 13 points,
      and we saw noticeably quicker page loading times.​

      following our SpeedOpp service, the rank increased by several positions on multiple
      pages, until we had several that showed up on the first page of Google search.
