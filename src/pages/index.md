  - title: Why SpeedOpp Works
    content: 'We''re not using any special sauce. We''re just mechanically addressing
      issues, identified by Google, that cause your website to load slower. Once implemented,
      these measures, like WebP images, Caching and File Minification speed up your
      site due to basic electrical theory -- less data transferred in one go = quicker
      loading times. '

    content: We had [Isotropic] address some opportunities from our PageSpeed report,
      like incoroating WebP images on our Wordpress website. Because our site is an
      image based portfolio, it loaded MUCH quicker than before.

    content: Was able to schedule and get on an info call the same day that I contacted
      the Isotropic Team. Within one day, our PageSpeed score increased by 13 points,
      and we saw noticeably quicker page loading times.​

    content: We track our PageRank in the Google Webmasters console. In the weeks
      following our SpeedOpp service, the rank increased by several positions on multiple
      pages, until we had several that showed up on the first page of Google search.
