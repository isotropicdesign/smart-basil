SpeedOpp is a service that mechanically addresses every PageSpeed opportunity identified by Google. We use tried-and-true methods, and guarantee an increase in your PageSpeed score.

As a result, your website will run quicker, rank higher, and convert more.

Here are some example methods we might employ to fix the following opportunities on a Wordpress site.

| **Properly size images** | We'll manually identify images that can be resized and compressed, determine the perfect size, resize and compress (losslessly) and reupload them to the site. |
| **Remove unused CSS** | We'll identify CSS that's not being called in specific pages and remove/disable it, leading to less data transfer needed on page load. |
| **Serve images in next-gen formats** | We'll install a plugin that automatically converts JPEGs and PNGs to WebP format and serves those formats to supporting browsers. If WebP isn't supported, we'll fallback optimized legacy formats. |
| **Reduce server response times (TTFB)** | We'll optimize how the server queries databases. In some cases, we'll recommend a move to a new web host (shared servers typically aren't the best option for some sites). |
| **Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy** | We'll determine the most effective cache lifetime for specific assets, and implement policies to control expires. |
