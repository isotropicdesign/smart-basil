SpeedOpp is a service that mechanically addresses every PageSpeed opportunity identified by Google. We use tried-and-true methods, and guarantee an increase in your PageSpeed score.

As a result, your website will run quicker, rank higher, and convert more.

Here are some example methods we might employ to fix the following opportunities on a Wordpress site.

<table >

	<tbody>

		<tr>

			<td>Properly size images</td>

			<td>We'll manually identify images that can be resized and compressed, determine the perfect size, resize and compress (losslessly) and reupload them to the site.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr>

			<td>Remove unused CSS</td>

			<td> </td>

		</tr>

		<tr>

			<td>Serve images in next-gen formats</td>

			<td>We'll install a plugin that automatically converts JPEGs and PNGs to WebP format and serves those formats to supporting browsers. If WebP isnt supported, we'll fallback optimized legacy formats.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr>

			<td>Reduce server response times (TTFB)</td>

			<td>We'll optimize how the server queries databases. In some cases, we'll recommend a move to a new web host (shared servers typically aren't the best option for some sites).</td>

		</tr>

        <tr>

			<td>Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy</td>

			<td>We'll determine the most effective cache lifetime for specific assets, and implement policies to control expires.</td>

		</tr>

	</tbody>

</table>
