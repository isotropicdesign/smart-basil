SpeedOpp is a service that mechanically addresses every PageSpeed opportunity identified by Google. We use tried-and-true methods, and guarantee an increase in your PageSpeed score.

As a result, your website will run quicker, rank higher, and convert more.

<table>
    <caption>Here are some example methods we might employ to fix the following opportunities on a Wordpress site.</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Speed Opportunity</th>
      <th>How We'd Address It</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Properly size images</td>
      <td>We'll manually identify images that can be resized and compressed, determine the perfect size, resize and compress (losslessly) and reupload them to the site.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Remove unused CSS</td>
      <td>We'll identify CSS that's not being called in specific pages and remove/disable it, leading to less data transfer needed on page load.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Serve images in next-gen formats</td>
      <td>We'll install a plugin that automatically converts JPEGs and PNGs to WebP format and serves those formats to supporting browsers. If WebP isn't supported, we'll fallback optimized legacy formats.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reduce server response times (TTFB)</td>
      <td>We'll optimize how the server queries databases. In some cases, we'll recommend a move to a new web host (shared servers typically aren't the best option for some sites).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy</td>
      <td>We'll determine the most effective cache lifetime for specific assets, and implement policies to control expires.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
