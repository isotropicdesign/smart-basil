SpeedOpp is a service that mechanically addresses every PageSpeed opportunity identified by Google. We use tried-and-true methods, and guarantee an increase in your PageSpeed score.

As a result, your website will run quicker, rank higher, and convert more.

Here are some example methods we might employ to fix the following opportunities on a Wordpress site.

<table>
    <caption>Table with thead, tfoot, and tbody</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header content 1</th>
      <th>Header content 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
