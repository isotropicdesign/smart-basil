Let's talk about why a speedy site = a good investment (of time or money).

When you increase your Google PageSpeed Score, you don't just get a quicker site. You get a whole host of "ripple benefits". Here are a few:

* The average bounce rate for a website that takes 5 seconds to load is 38%. That bounce rate drops to 7% when your site takes 1.5 seconds to load.
* 47% of customers expect a webpage to load in 2 seconds or less.
* Walmart found that for every 1 second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%.

_üëÜ About that graphic ‚òù_

It's true. When you make your website faster, you rank higher on Google. Google will place faster loading sites on Page 1-2, and because of 75% of people don't even scroll to page 2, you need to be on page 1.

When you boost your page placements on search engine results with a faster site, you get more visits (and 93% of them come from a search engine, so this is important). Additionally, your user experience is bolstered from a quicker, snappier site and the combination of both of these elements leads to happier visitors. Faster sites, more (and happier) visitors and better UX leads to more conversions to leads. And finally, more leads result in more revenue.
