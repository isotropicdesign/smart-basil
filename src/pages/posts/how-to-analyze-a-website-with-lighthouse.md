## Lighthouse Intro

Lighthouse is a tool best known by Developers and Digital Agency that helps improve websites and web apps. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.

[From Google:](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

> You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

The tool is set up in a way that _anyone_ can access and use its suite of features, not just developers. This post is for those who are curious on what may be wrong with their site and want to use Lighthouse to figure out how to improve it. 

## How To Access/Use It

Access the online tool here: [https://web.dev/measure/](https://web.dev/measure/ "https://web.dev/measure/")

Enter your site URL and hit run audit. 

You'll then get a list of all the audits you need to take a look at.

However, the actual value comes from the Lighthouse report. To access it click "View Report" next to your site URL.

The report will give you immensely detailed statistics, audits, and site-specific suggestions on how to pass those that the site failed.

The remainder of this article will discuss what makes up a Lighthouse report, how to interpret the it's various aspects/ratings/recommendation.

## Scores

The most important score when it comes to PageSpeed (the issue that SpeedOpp fixes) is the Performance score.

 According to Google, Lighthouse returns a Performance score between 0 and 100. 100 is the best possible score which represents the 98th percentile, a top-performing site. A score of 50 represents the 75th percentile. 

They get this aggregate score by individually scoring individual performance audits, weighing each one, and combining them into the Performance score. 

You can learn more here: 

[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring "https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring")

If you have a slow site, you're losing money. SpeedOpp makes your site run faster by addressing every opportunity generated by Lighthouse, boosting this score, page speed, and SEO.

Additional scores include Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO and PWA (if applicable). Let's discuss each one and why it may be helpful to a website owner or designer. 

## Accessibility

This score lets you know how accessible your site is. In most scenarios, you _need_ to have a high score on this due to accessibility legislation like ADA. 

If you get it wrong, you open yourself up to legal liability.  

It'll run several audits and display the failed ones, as well as suggestions on how to pass it. 

![](https://i.snipboard.io/avUOKj.jpg)

The tool does note that it can only detect some accessibility aspect of the website, and that it's best to have a manual audit. 

This is true: you should have a reputable agency that knows the legislation surrounding accessibility make the needed changes to your website. 

Depending on your businesses, you may even want to hire a lawyer to audit the site as well.

## Best Practices

When designing a website there are a collection of best practices that should be followed. Formally, Google has a published list of these practices, but there are also unspoken/ individual practices that should always be included on a website. 

That's why if you're serious about your web presence, you should hire a reputable design agency like us ([Isotropic](https://isotropic.co)).

This score is an aggregate from pass/fail audits. These audits are taken from Google's best practice list. An example of some of these audits are: 

* Avoids Application Cache
* Uses HTTPS
* Uses HTTP/2 for its own resources
* Uses passive listeners to improve scrolling performance
* Avoids document.write()

Like most of the other outputs, if you fail this audit, Lighthouse will give you suggestions on how to pass it. For example, if you fail the "Security Vulnerabilities", it'll tell you what made you fail this, link to the script, and tell you how to fix it. 

![](https://i.snipboard.io/GXUoPY.jpg)

It will also mention the severity of this vulnerability. If you're uncomfortable in fixing this yourself, you can reach out to [Isotropic](https://isotropic.co) and we'll fix this within 6 hours of your contact.

## SEO 

Lighthouse runs several audits related to SEO. Some include:

* Has a <meta name="viewport"> tag with width or initial-scale
* Document has a <title> element
* Document has a meta description
* Page has successful HTTP status code

If the website doesn't pass an audit, it will alert you and tell you how to fix it. For example, if your site returns a failed audit titled "**Page isnâ€™t blocked from indexing"**, Lighthouse will tell you that "Search engines are unable to include your pages in search results if they don't have permission to crawl them." You then know that you need to fix this. 

If it's able to find an explicit cause of the SEO issue (typically it is), then the report will _tell you what to fix._ For example, if you fail the Index audit mentioned above, the tool may tell you to fix your Robots.txt by naming this code as a "Blocking Directive Source".

    <meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>

## CLI

Lighthouse also offers devs a node based CLI that's super helpful and powerful.

You can install it using several methods, but the easiest for us is "_$ Yarn Add Lighthouse_". One auto install later, and you have Lighthouse installed. 

We use CMD to run and generate our reports.

    $ lighthouse https://www.example.com --chrome-flags="--headless" --quiet --view --output-path ...\SpeedOpp\speedopp-report.html --emulated-form-factor desktop

When we run that command, Lighthouse will run in the background and spit out a report in HTML format. We can either email this file to clients or screenshot important sections. 

We've also set it up to upload (if you're a developer and want to test our beta online report generator, reach out) that file to a SpeedOpp client specific portal.

The report is super detailed, well designed and get its information across well. However, if you choose, you can output a JSON and generate your own custom report format from that. Here's what a section looks like: 

![](https://i.snipboard.io/rYEy2c.jpg)

Basically it combines all of Google's online testing tools into one, pretty report, generated from your CLI. 

Using Lighthouse through the CLI gives you easy access to a stunning amount of features, for free. I've pasted all of command suggestions that Lighthouse outputs when entering "lighthouse --help"
